# Exercism sed track

Sed (**S**tream **ED**itor) is a very practical and fun Turing-Complete esoteric language mostly used for text manipulations.

## Language variant

We'll use [GNU Sed][sed-home] with all GNU extensions and [*ERE* (Extended Regular Expression)][ere-info] in this track. It's recommended to not use `e` command.

## Testing framework

Testing will be done with [`bats-core`][bats] from the **Bash Track**.

## Support

Get help on the [Exercism forum][forum].
